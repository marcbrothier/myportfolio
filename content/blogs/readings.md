I like to read adventures, thriller, romance books, but in the most famous classic that I really enjoyed, my top list would be:
1. “Le Comte de Monte-Cristo”
Le Comte de Monte Cristo, Tome I (French Edition)

A classic adventure novel by Alexandre Dumas, “Le Comte de Monte-Cristo” is one of the most popular French books of all time. Following the very lucky life of central character Edmond Dantès, the book plots his initial rise and subsequent fall from grace. Blessed with a good job, popularity and a beautiful fiancée, Dantès is the envy of everyone around him until three men choose to plot against him, wrongfully accusing him of treason.

2. “Madame Bovary”
Madame Bovary (French Edition)

Gustave Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary” is a very classic example of French literature, and is still incredibly popular today. The book looks at the effects of the rise of a bourgeois culture, showing a time when people who were capable of providing a good income for themselves became focused on their social image.


3. “Les Misérables”
Les misérables

While most people are more familiar with the hugely famous musical, the story of “Les Misérables” found initial fame in Victor Hugo’s novel of the same name, which is built around French historical events of the early 19th century. A longer narrative, “Les Misérables” the book follows characters in linear progression, looking into the lives of each person in much more detail than the musical does. As characters go about their lives, meet and part, you get a much more focused understanding of French culture at the time, as well as the reasoning behind and details within the Paris Uprising of 1832.


4. “L’Étranger”
L'étranger (Collection Folio, no. 2) (French Edition)

One of the most well-known French books of all time, it’s a great read for learners to consider, and still holds a significant place in French culture.

A great introduction into the tricky topic of existentialism, the book tells the story of Meursault, a pied-noir (European living in Algeria during the French rule there) who, after attending his mother’s funeral, thoughtlessly kills an Arab man. The story is split into the time before and after the murder, following the innermost thoughts of Meursault as he reasons with himself about his actions.


5. “Thérèse Raquin”
Thérèse Raquin (French Edition)

The French are no strangers to doomed love. Written by naturalist author Émile Zola, “Thérèse Raquin” tells a love story with disastrous consequences for everyone involved. Central character Thérèse is betrothed to her sickly cousin, but just after their marriage, she meets her husband’s friend Laurent and soon becomes involved in an affair. In the hopes of making their lives easier, the cheating pair become embroiled in a dark plot that has incredibly grave consequences and pretty soon, things take a turn for the worse.


6. “Les Fleurs du mal”
Les Fleurs du Mal (French Edition)

Not all great French books are novels, however, and some of the greatest language lessons can be learned from classic French poetry. Perhaps the most famous of all non-narrative French writing, Charles Baudelaire’s “Les Fleurs du mal” is a great example of French philosophical thought, and pinpoints an important time in the country’s culture. Split into six themed sections, the poems delve into modernism and symbolism, mirroring popular cultural thought in 19th-century France.


7. “Bel-Ami”
Bel-Ami (French Edition)

Written by celebrated French author Guy de Maupassant, “Bel-Ami” is a classic rags-to-riches tale, plotting everything that happens in between. Based around fictional journalist Georges Duroy’s life, the novel reveals how his manipulation of powerful and wealthy mistresses ensures his place on France’s social stage. As the plot follows Duroy’s life and affairs, we see how how his calculated moves influence the course of his life, and the greater effects that they have on other people.


8. “Tartuffe”
Tartuffe and the Bourgeois Gentleman (Dual-Language) (English and French Edition)

A morality tale, “Tartuffe” is one of the most popular pieces of French writing. Presented almost entirely in dialogue format, it plunges readers into a whole new world of conversational French. Due to the theatrical nature of the piece, you can expect to come face-to-face with a number of literary forms, such as the soliloquy. Literature in French doesn’t get much better than this, and if you want to perfect your own reading and writing skills, “Tartuffe” is a great text to get your hands on.

9. “La Cousine Bette”
Penned by one of the most prolific French writers—Honoré de Balzac—“La Cousine Bette“ is an incredibly popular classic read in France. Set in the mid-1800s, the novel follows a middle-aged married woman who is unsatisfied in her life and her marriage. Like many in her position, she curses the influence her extended family have on her life, and in a moment of madness, she decides to plot their downfall. Working with another unhappy lady, Bette proceeds to lure in and destroy a number of her male relations—something which, unsurprisingly, does not lead to positive things for the family.


10. “La Gloire de mon père”
La Gloire de Mon Père (Fortunio) (French Edition)

A favorite amongst readers all over the world, author Marcel Pagnol is renowned for his accurate descriptions of rural French life and heartbreaking tales of family. The first in a series of novels that follow the same characters, “La Gloire de mon père“ is a celebrated novel. Focusing on the Pagnol family during their summer holidays, the book reveals how each member is affected by their brief stay in a small rural village and hints at tensions growing as a result of differing belief systems.
