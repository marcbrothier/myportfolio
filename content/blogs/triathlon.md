Driven by the desire to learn and surpass myself, extracurricular activities has always been a way to keep challenging myself.

Passionate about triathlon, I have completed two marathons (Amsterdam and Paris) as well as various trails and triathlons, including a Half Iron Man. I am now training for an Iron Man, a long-distance triathlon (3.8km swimming, 180km cycling and a marathon).

I am now training for the Ironman 140.6 Nice taking place the 12th of June 2021 as well as the Ironman 70.3 of Venice in May 2021.
