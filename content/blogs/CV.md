After internships in M&A and Private Equity, I chose to pursue my Masters in Financials Analysis at the London Business School to be fully prepared to undertake a career in Investment Banking in London. I truly believe that the technical skills and the excellent attention to detail that I developed during these experiences will be a strong added value to your team.
